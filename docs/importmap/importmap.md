# import map

An importmap file is part of this codebase to make ESLint and VSCode capable to resolve imports.

This is needed because there is currently no ESLint plugin and no VSCode extension implementing node [esm resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_resolution_algorithm).

It is mandatory to help ESLint as it is configured to complain in case an import cannot be resolved which is super helpful while coding.

It is very valuable to help VSCode so that `cmd+click` on a variable open the file where it is declared. It also improves VSCode autocompletion because it can suggest what is found in the imported file.

If you want to keep that check [How to use importmap](#how-to-use-importmap). Otherwise see [How to remove importmap](#how-to-remove-importmap).

# How to use importmap

The importmap file is generated by [script/generate-import-map/generate-import-map.js](../../script/generate-import-map/generate-import-map.js).

This script is executed after every `npm install` thanks to `"postinstall"` script in [package.json](../../package.json#L55).

To sum up you should regenerate the importmap file everytime you update your `package.json` to keep it in sync.

# How to remove importmap

**Warning**: ESLint and VSCode need this to properly resolve imports as [explained above](#import-map)

If you want to remove importmap from this repository, follow the steps below.

1. Remove `"node ./script/transform-package/remove-postinstall.js && "` from `"prepublishOnly"` in [package.json](../../package.json#L56)
2. Remove `"postpublish"` from `"scripts"` in [package.json](../../package.json#L57)
3. Remove `"postinstall"` from `"scripts"` in [package.json](../../package.json#L55)
4. Remove `"generate-import-map"` from `"scripts"` in [package.json](../../package.json#L47)
5. Delete [script/generate-import-map/](../../script/generate-import-map/) directory
6. Replace `"import/resolver"` in [.eslintrc.cjs](../../.eslintrc.cjs#L45)

   ```diff
   - "@jsenv/importmap-eslint-resolver": {
   -   projectDirectoryUrl: __dirname,
   -   importMapFileRelativeUrl: "./importmap.dev.importmap",
   -   node: true,
   - },
   + "node": {}
   ```

7. Remove `"@jsenv/importmap-eslint-resolver"` from `"devDependencies"` in [package.json](../../package.json#L68)
8. Remove `/importmap.dev.importmap` in [.gitignore](../../.gitignore#L23)
9. Delete `./importmap.dev.importmap` file
10. Remove `"paths"` from `./jsconfig.json` file
