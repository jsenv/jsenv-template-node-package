# This file configure a GitHub workflow responsible to perform
# various checks related to the codebase.
#
# For that reason it's runned on every pull request and push to master.
#
# It does the following:
#  - Check linting passes (no eslint error on files)
#  - Run tests and ensure none is failing
#  - Update tests code coverage
#
# If all these steps are passing the workflow ends up
# publishing package on npm if needed. It will publish the npm package
# using the token found in secrets.NPM_TOKEN. Be sure to create this
# token in the GitHub repository.
